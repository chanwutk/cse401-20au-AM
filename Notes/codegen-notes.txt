How much is working:
  Everything in MiniJava, including methods with arbitrary number of parameters.

Changes in symbol table:
  - We added method vtable offset into class information
  - We added variable locations into variable info, which include offsets
    and where the offset is based on (`this` or `%rbp`).

Other interesting things:
  When we have array index out of bound or null pointer or uncaught exception, we print an error message and call C `abort()`.
